Fisheye menus.
With this type of menu, all the menu items are displayed on the user interface at once. 
When a menu item is pointed or clicked at, it becomes “larger” compared with the rest of the menu items. 

For example, in the user interface below, the menu item that is pointed at has become “larger” compared with the rest of the menu items.
During this “larger” state, the menu item displays more details about itself (i.e. “Firefox”).
 
Each specific group in the class should use the same idea above (see *), but to design a menu for a web-based guide to the 10 usability heuristics.
 The menu should have 10 menu items. 
 Each of the menu items should be an object with a label of the respective usability heuristic i.e., using the following labels: UH#1, UH#2, UH#3, …, UH#10. 
 When a menu item is pointed or clicked at, it becomes “larger” compared with the rest of the menu items. During this “larger” state,
    the menu item displays more details about the respective usability heuristic (for example for the UH#5 menu item when in the “larger” state, it could display the textual details “Error prevention”).
